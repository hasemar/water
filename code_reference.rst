=============================
Water Package Code Reference
=============================
This package contains several python classes that allow for the creation of common water system assets
by using object-oriented programming. There are also modules containing useful functions for common 
calculations in water system desin. Currently Units are in industry standard ft, lb, s, gpm, psi, etc.

# TODO In future would like to make the units "user specifiable".
